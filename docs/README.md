# TeleCrypt Documentation

This folder is the canonical source for project docs. When a section stabilizes,
we mirror it into the GitHub wiki.

## Contents
- DEV_SETUP.md: local build/run instructions
- ARCHITECTURE.md: high-level architecture and module map
- CALLS.md: current call approach and known gaps
- CALLS_PROTOCOL.md: MatrixRTC signaling notes and call state model
- CI.md: CI pipelines and required secrets

## Contributing
- Keep changes small and focused.
- Prefer ASCII and plain Markdown.
- Link to code with paths like `src/commonMain/...`.
